# TFT Team Builder

A web application for building and theorycrafting team compositions in Teamfight Tactics (TFT). Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

This project is a side project born from my love for Teamfight Tactics. It allows players to:
- Drag and drop champions onto a hex board
- View active trait combinations
- Sort champions by cost, name, or traits
- Filter champions by specific traits
- Move champions around the board to test different positions
- Clear the board to start fresh

## Features

- **Interactive Hex Board**: A realistic representation of the TFT game board
- **Champion Library**: Complete list of Set 13 champions with their traits
- **Trait Counter**: Real-time tracking of active traits on your board
- **Duplicate Detection**: Warns when duplicate champions are placed (as traits don't stack from duplicates)
- **Intuitive Controls**: 
  - Drag and drop champions
  - Double-click to remove champions
  - Sort and filter options for easy champion selection

## Tech Stack

- Frontend:
  - Next.js
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - DND Kit (for drag and drop functionality)
